 About me
🌱 I’ve completed an OpenClassrooms training program as Artificial Intelligence Engineer (July 2020 - December 2021), developed in partnership with Microsoft and Centrale Supelec. Details can be found here.

🛫 I keep on learning Data Science, Machine and Deep learning, Cloud computing, and deployment of algorithms into production.

💞️ I'm really interested in problem solving and decision taking with data ; my focus is to develop, optimize and reformulate repeatable models to solve challenging and high-value business problems, and provide actionable insights.

🚧 I love working in a cross-functional environment, to collaborate with different teams on all data-related topics (data management, data engineering, data science, etc.).

📫 How to reach me : I can add you as a collaborator if needed and share my LinkedIn details too. Keep in touch!
